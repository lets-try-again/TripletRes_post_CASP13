1. What is TripletRes?
    TripletRes is a program for protein contact-map prediction by coupling a triplet of coevolutionary analysis 
    features with fully Residual neurl networks.
   1.1 Version	
	This version is newly trained on 26,151 PDB structures.

2. How to install the TripletRes?

    1) Prerequisites
        Python3 with numpy and scipy installed
        pytorch 1.0 or higher(https://pytorch.org/)
        Anaconda is recommended to set up python environments
    2) There is an executable file under 'bin' path, Maybe you also need set 
        executable permission to the bin file.
	3) Install CCMpred(https://github.com/soedinglab/CCMpred) and put executable ccmpred file to bin/ccmpred

    Please visit https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/bbs/?q=forum/2

4. How to run the TripletRes?
	python TripletRes.py [msa_file] [outfile]
		msa_file: Multiple Sequence Alignment file
		outfile:  Output file, each line in this format: [position1 position2 score]
		where position index start from 1 [NOT 0]

5. Example
	You can test by fowllowing commands:
		' python TripletRes.py test/seq.aln test/seq.out '
	It will generate 2 files:
		' seq.out.weight ': Weights for each sequence in msa, you can just ignore it.
		' seq.out '       : Output file
